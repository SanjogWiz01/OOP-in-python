# core concept
''' üìö 1. Library System
üéØ Goal:

To manage books in a library using Object-Oriented Programming ‚Äî we‚Äôll create objects to represent both Books and the Library that stores and manages them.

üß© Classes Involved:
üîπ Class: Book

Represents a single book in the library.

Each Book object will have:

title (e.g., ‚ÄúPython Crash Course‚Äù)

author

available (True/False to show if it‚Äôs currently borrowed)

‚úÖ The Book class is like a blueprint for each book ‚Äî it just holds information about one item.

üîπ Class: Library

Represents the entire library.

The library will have:

A list (or collection) of Book objects.

Methods (functions) to manage them.

Main Methods:

add_book()

Adds a new book object to the library‚Äôs list.

Like storing a new book in the library shelf.

lend_book()

Marks a book as borrowed (not available).

The system checks if the book exists and isn‚Äôt already lent.

return_book()

Marks a previously lent book as available again.

It‚Äôs like putting the book back on the shelf.

üí° Concept Focus:

Encapsulation: Data (title, author, available) and methods (lend, return) are combined in one object.

Objects interaction: Library object uses Book objects to perform tasks.

Real-world mapping: Just like a real library manages books and their borrowing system.'''
